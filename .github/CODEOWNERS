# .github/CODEOWNERS

# This is an example CODEOWNERS file.
# Each line defines one or more code owners responsible for reviewing changes to specific files or folders.

# Comments start with '#' and are ignored.
# Blank lines are also ignored.

# Default Owners
# These owners will be automatically assigned to review any files in the project
# that are not covered by more specific rules below.
* @piyuo # Default reviewers for the entire project

# File-Specific Owners
# Ensure these individuals are notified whenever this specific file changes.
/README.md      @piyuo # Owner for the README file
/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md @piyuo # Owner for the contributing guidelines

# Folder-Specific Owners
# When a folder is specified, it covers that folder and all its subfolders and files.
/src/backend/      @your-org/backend-team @charlie # Owners for backend code
/src/frontend/components/ @diana # Owner for frontend components

# Exclusion Rules
# Use '!' to exclude files or folders that were previously covered by a rule.
# For example, /docs/ is owned by @documentation-team, but /docs/api/ is owned by @api-owners.
/docs/          @documentation-team
!/docs/api/     @api-owners # ! means exclude, API documentation is owned by the API team

# File Type Owners
# The asterisk (*) is a wildcard that matches any characters.
# If you want to specify owners for all .js files:
*.js        @javascript-expert # Owner for all .js files

# Specific file types within a specific subfolder
/tests/*.py     @qa-team # All .py test files within the 'tests' folder

# Note: Rules are processed from top to bottom.
# More specific paths override less specific paths.
# For example:
# /src/frontend/components/Navbar.js @eve # Owner for Navbar.js
# /src/frontend/components/         @diana # But if Navbar.js changes, @eve will be prioritized.
